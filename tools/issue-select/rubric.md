# Rubric: is this a good first issue?

<!--
THIS IS THE PART YOU WRITE. The skill in SKILL.md executes whatever checks
you define here. It ships empty on purpose: the judgment is your work.

A filled rubric must contain:

1. At least one row in the checks table. Each row needs all four columns:
   - Check: a short name (used in the output JSON).
   - Evidence: exactly what to look at, and where. Name the source
     (repo-facts block, issue body, comment thread, or the locations in
     references/evidence-guide.md). "The repo" is not a source; "the last
     5 default-branch commit dates" is.
   - Pass condition: a condition someone else could apply and get your
     answer. Prefer thresholds with numbers ("a maintainer commented
     within 30 days") over adjectives ("maintainer is responsive").
   - Weight: `required` (a fail here rejects the issue) or `preferred`
     (never changes the verdict; a nice-to-have that helps rank the
     issues you accept).

2. A verdict rule below the table: how the check grades combine into
   accept or reject, including how `unclear` is treated. The verdict
   space is binary. If you write no rule for `unclear`, the skill treats
   it as fail.

Cover what actually kills first contributions. The lecture named four
families: the maintainer is alive, the repo is in use, the scope fits a
newcomer, and nobody else is already on it. A rubric that ignores a family
will fail eval issues designed around that family.

## Checks

| Check | Evidence | Pass condition | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Maintainer alive | The last 5 default-branch commits under Repo facts, the maintainer first-response sample under Repo facts, and maintainer comments in the issue's Comments section | Pass if either the last 5 default-branch commits include human maintainer activity within 365 days before the bundle capture date, or an Owner, Member, or Collaborator replies in the first-response sample or this issue thread. Bot-only activity and older history alone do not count as current maintainer life | required |
| Repo in use | The `archived` flag, `latest release`, `last push to any branch`, and adoption counts under Repo facts, using the Family 2 signals in `references/evidence-guide.md` | Pass if the repository is not archived and the evidence shows current use through a release, a moving branch, or meaningful adoption such as stars or a `Used by` count. An archived repository fails regardless of other signals | required |
| Scope fits a newcomer | The issue body and Comments section, using the Family 3 guidance in `references/evidence-guide.md` | Pass if the issue asks for one bounded contribution and gives a concrete specification through reproduction steps, expected behavior, acceptance criteria, a named documentation home, or a maintainer diagnosis. A concrete issue filed by an Owner, Member, or Collaborator can pass even when the body is brief. Related file or documentation updates can be one contribution, and a detailed technical checklist or several implementation suggestions for one reported symptom is evidence of scope rather than evidence of excess scope. Do not require a maintainer to have confirmed a contributor-authored issue or to have commented on a clear issue. Fail explicit umbrella or tracking issues, pure usage questions, unresolved design debates, unresolved product decisions or required assets, years of unresolved discussion, multiple abandoned attempts showing the real difficulty, issues with no actionable specification, or work explicitly involving broad core-internal changes. A short issue, missing reproduction steps, or a good-first-issue label is not automatically a failure | required |
| Unclaimed | The issue's `assignees` and `linked PRs` under Repo facts, plus claim comments and PR mentions in the Comments section | Pass if there is no assignee, no open linked or mentioned pull request, and no current contributor claim or implementation comment. A closed unmerged pull request or an old abandoned claim is not an active claim | required |
| Contribution policy permits the work | The repository's contribution policy and any AI policy files, templates, or linked contributor documents under Repo facts | Pass if the policy is silent or permits AI-assisted contributions under stated conditions. Fail only when the policy explicitly bans AI-generated code or documentation; disclosure, review, testing, and understanding requirements are conditions to follow, not bans | required |

## Verdict rule

Accept only if all five required checks pass. Reject if any required check
fails. Treat `unclear` as fail for a required check because a newcomer
should not take an issue whose suitability cannot be verified.
